# MCA Next.js Home (test folder)

This is a minimal Next.js scaffold created inside the `test` folder.

Quick start:

# MCA Next.js Home (test folder)

This is a minimal Next.js scaffold created inside the `test` folder. It now contains a small, attractive Todo app that stores items in your browser's `localStorage`.

Quick start:

```bash
cd "test"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

What you'll find:

- `package.json` — project metadata and scripts
- `pages/index.js` — homepage with the Todo app
- `pages/_app.js` — global styles wrapper
- `styles/global.css` — global and app styles

The Todo app supports:

- Add new items
- Toggle complete
- Delete items
- Clear completed

Notes:

- Data is saved in `localStorage` under the key `mca_todos_v1`.
- If you'd like an `app/`-router version or server-side persistence, I can convert it.
